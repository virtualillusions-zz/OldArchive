will save you a great deal of time during design.

o Sound – Effects used to add an audio ambiance.
o Music – Tracks for the game soundtrack.
o Speech – Any vocalized audio file that will convey dialog or is to be
							spoken by a character.

	design ideas without modifying code that needs to be compiled.
